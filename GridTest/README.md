## Overview:
This is a Pathfinding Visualizer application. It was made by John Humphrey for CS 240 at WCC. 
It uses C# with Avalonia and incorporates a graph data structure. It then uses any number of algorithms to traverse the graph and find the shortest path.

## Instructions:
Currently there is not an installer for the program. The user will need to install dependencies and then compile and run from their preferred .NET workspace.

## About:


## Dependencies:
- **.NET 9.0 SDK/Runtime:**  
  The project targets .NET 9.0. Users will need to have the appropriate .NET SDK installed to build and run the application.

- **Avalonia UI Framework:**  
  The application uses Avalonia for its cross-platform graphical user interface. Avalonia provides a rich, XAML-based UI framework that enables a consistent look and feel across multiple operating systems.

Please consult the project file (e.g., .csproj) for a complete list of dependencies and exact package versions.
